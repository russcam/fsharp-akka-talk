# Akka.NET with F# - Getting functional with Reactive systems

[Presentation at the F# Sydney meetup](http://www.meetup.com/fsharpsydney/events/219822421/)

Writing highly concurrent, fault tolerant and scalable systems that need to handle high throughput and low latency is a challenging endeavour. Akka.NET toolkit provides a suite of higher level abstractions to build such Reactive systems and this talk will introduce them from an F# perspective.
